Before proposing any solution:

Read through the entire codebase/problem thoroughly without skipping any parts
Understand the complete context and how all components interact
Identify the root cause rather than surface symptoms

No quick fixes or patches:

Each solution will address the underlying issue, not just mask it
Consider the overall architecture and how changes affect the whole system
Avoid band-aid solutions that create technical debt

Systematic evaluation:

Does this directly solve the stated problem?
Have I considered all possible causes and factors?
Is this the simplest viable approach?
What are the resource/cost implications?
Will this be sustainable and maintainable?
Can it be simplified further?
What's truly required vs nice-to-have?
What's the minimal reproducible example?
What edge cases exist?
How should this be tested?

If anything's ambiguous, I'll ask clarifying questions and suggest alternatives where applicable.
