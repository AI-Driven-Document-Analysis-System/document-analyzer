The negative values indicate that the company's financial liabilities significantly exceed its financial assets.\n\n---\n\n### Major Changes in Financial Assets Composition\n\nThe composition of Nestle's financial assets changed notably from 2023 to 2024, both by class and by measurement category.\n\n#### Changes by Class\n\nThe most significant increases in asset classes were:\n\n*   **Bonds and debt funds**: Increased by **1,096 million CHF** (from 822 to 1,918).\n*   **Equity and equity funds**: Increased by **557 million CHF** (from 692 to 1,249).\n*   **Other financial assets**: Increased by **388 million CHF** (from 1,845 to 2,233).\n*   **Time deposits**: Increased by **595 million CHF** (from 923 to 1,518).\n*   **Derivative assets**: Increased by **468 million CHF** (from 408 to 876).\n\nIn contrast, **Cash at bank and in hand** decreased by **260 million CHF**.\n\n#### Changes by Measurement Category\n\nThe way these assets are measured and reported on the balance sheet also shifted significantly.\n\n*   **Assets at Fair Value through Income Statement**:\n    *   Increased dramatically by **1,780 million CHF** (from 2,085 to 3,865).\n    *   This category includes trading assets and derivatives not in hedge relationships. The large increase is driven by growth in **Bonds and debt funds** and **Derivative assets**.\n\n*   **Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)**:\n    *   More than doubled, increasing by **435 million CHF** (from 390 to 825).\n    *   This growth was primarily due to a large increase in **Equity and equity funds** designated as FVOCI.\n\n*   **Assets at Amortized Cost**:\n    *   Increased by **1,232 million CHF** (from 17,726 to 18,958).\n    *   This category includes most of the company's liquid assets (like cash and commercial paper) and trade receivables.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn 2024, Nestle Group significantly increased its holdings of financial assets, particularly in **bonds, debt funds, and equity investments**. A major trend was the shift towards assets measured at **fair value**, especially those whose value changes flow directly through the income statement. Despite the growth in total financial assets, the company's **net financial position became more negative** due to an even larger increase in financial liabilities (notably financial debt, which increased from 55,241 to 63,560 million CHF).""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",28.197,"{""promptTokens"":0,""completionTokens"":0,""totalTokens"":0}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2025-10-01

In 2019, it was **100,051** (thousands of Swiss francs).\n\nThis represents a significant **increase of 42,656** (thousands of Swiss francs) in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n### Main Factors Contributing to the Change in Cash Position\n\nThe overall change in the cash position is determined by the net result of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, plus the effect of exchange rate changes.\n\n**1. Primary Driver: Strong Operating Cash Flow**\n- The **increase of 42,656** in net cash from operating activities was the single largest positive contributor to the cash position. This indicates the core business operations generated significantly more cash in 2020.\n\n**2. Major Use of Cash: Investing Activities**\n- Cash flows from investing activities were a major outflow in both years.\n- In 2020, the net cash used in investing activities was **-204,659**, a substantial increase in cash outflow compared to **-117,070** in 2019.\n- The primary factor in this increased outflow was a much larger `(Increase) in investments`, which was **-240,431** in 2020 versus **-154,925** in 2019. This suggests a significant acquisition of investments during the year.\n\n**3. Minor Impact: Financing Activities**\n- Cash flows from financing activities had a minimal positive impact in 2020 (**519**), compared to no activity in 2019.\n\n**4. Negative Impact: Exchange Rate Changes**\n- The effect of exchange rate changes on cash was negative in 2020 (**-1,058**), further reducing the cash balance.\n\n### Summary of Overall Cash Position Change\n\nThe combination of these factors resulted in a **net decrease in cash and cash equivalents** for the year.\n\n- **Net Increase/(Decrease) in Cash (2020):** `-62,491` (thousands of Swiss francs)\n- **Net Increase/(Decrease) in Cash (2019):** `-16,889` (thousands of Swiss francs)\n\nIn conclusion, while the organization's operating performance improved dramatically in 2020, this was more than offset by a large increase in cash outflows for investing activities (primarily for new investments), leading to an overall reduction in the cash balance.""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",21.13,"{""promptTokens"":0,""completionTokens"":0,""totalTokens"":0}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2025-10-01

The analysis of these mechanisms and the inclusion of a mandatory Comptroller General review reveals a clear and deliberate congressional strategy.\n\n#### **Functional Difference Between the Two Termination Mechanisms**\n\nThe two termination mechanisms serve different functional purposes, reflecting the nature of the programs or requirements they govern.\n\n-   **Fixed Sunset Date for the Veterans Experience Office (VEO):**\n    -   A **sunset date** (e.g., September 30, 2028) is a specific, calendar-based termination point. It is an absolute deadline for the existence of the office or program.\n    -   **Function:** This mechanism creates a **\""hard stop\""** for the VEO. It forces a deliberate congressional re-evaluation and affirmative action to reauthorize the office. If Congress takes no action, the office ceases to exist. This is typically used for pilot programs, new initiatives, or entities whose long-term necessity Congress wishes to reassess after a trial period.\n\n-   **Fixed Duration for Quarterly Briefings:**\n    -   A **fixed duration** (e.g., \""three years after the date of the enactment\"") is a period-based termination. The requirement is active for a set length of time from the law's effective date.\n    -   **Function:** This mechanism addresses a **temporary need for oversight and information**. Congress anticipates that after three years of mandatory, in-person briefings on budgetary shortfalls, the Department of Veterans Affairs will have either resolved the underlying issues or established sufficient reporting protocols. The requirement expires automatically without needing further legislation to end it, but it also does not require a \""re-authorization\"" vote to continue.\n\n**In essence:**\n`A sunset date terminates an entity (the VEO), while a fixed duration terminates a requirement (the briefings).`\n\n#### **Congressional Intent Revealed by the Comptroller General Review**\n\nThe inclusion of a mandatory review by the Comptroller General (the head of the Government Accountability Office) 540 days after enactment is a critical piece of the legislative design that reveals specific congressional intent.\n\n-   **Proactive and Data-Driven Oversight:** Mandating a review well **before** the VEO's sunset date indicates that Congress does not intend to wait until the last minute to decide the office's fate. It wants a **comprehensive, independent analysis** of the VEO's performance and effectiveness to inform its decision.\n\n-   **Intent to Inform Reauthorization:** The timing of the review is strategically designed to feed directly into the reauthorization process. The report from the Comptroller General will provide:\n    -   An objective assessment of the VEO's value.\n    -   Data on its accomplishments and shortcomings.\n    -   Potential recommendations for improvement.\n\n    Congress can use this report to draft a more informed reauthorization bill, perhaps with modifications, or to justify allowing the sunset provision to take effect.\n\n-   **Layered Accountability:** The Act creates a multi-layered oversight structure:\n    1.  **Short-Term (Quarterly):** Direct, high-level accountability from the VA Secretary to congressional committees.\n    2.  **Mid-Term (540 days):** An independent, deep-dive evaluation by the Comptroller General.\n    3.  **Long-Term (Sunset Date):** A final legislative decision point based on the accumulated data and analysis.\n\n**In summary, the inclusion of the Comptroller General review demonstrates that Congress is implementing a deliberate, evidence-based process to determine the long-term future of the Veterans Experience Office, ensuring that the decision to reauthorize or sunset it is not based on conjecture but on a formal assessment of its results.**""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",33.084,"{""promptTokens"":0,""completionTokens"":0,""totalTokens"":0}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2025-10-01

This analysis will delve into the functional differences between the termination mechanisms of the Veterans Experience Office and the quarterly budgetary briefing requirement, as well as what the inclusion of a mandatory Comptroller General review reveals about congressional intent.\n\n### Termination Mechanisms\n\n#### Veterans Experience Office Sunset Date\n\n* The Veterans Experience Office has a fixed sunset date of **September 30, 2028**.\n* This means that the Office will automatically be terminated on this date unless Congress takes action to extend or reauthorize it.\n\n#### Quarterly Budgetary Briefing Requirement\n\n* The quarterly budgetary briefing requirement lasts for a fixed duration of **three years**.\n* This means that the requirement for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide quarterly briefings to Congress will automatically expire after three years.\n\n### Functional Differences between Termination Mechanisms\n\n* **Automatic vs. Manual Termination**: The Veterans Experience Office sunset date represents an automatic termination mechanism, whereas the quarterly budgetary briefing requirement requires Congress to take action to expire it.\n* **Duration**: The Office's sunset date is tied to a specific date, while the briefing requirement has a fixed duration of three years.\n\n### Mandatory Comptroller General Review\n\n* A mandatory Comptroller General review is required **540 days after enactment**, well before the Office's sunset date of September 30, 2028.\n* This review will analyze the findings of the Comptroller General with respect to the analysis completed pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n### Congressional Intent\n\n* The inclusion of a mandatory Comptroller General review suggests that Congress intends to **evaluate the effectiveness** of the Veterans Experience Office and the quarterly budgetary briefing requirement before the Office's sunset date.\n* This review will provide Congress with valuable insights into the Office's performance and the impact of the briefing requirement, allowing them to make informed decisions about the Office's future.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe legislative design of the PRO Veterans Act of 2025 reflects a careful consideration of the termination mechanisms and congressional intent. The inclusion of a mandatory Comptroller General review 540 days after enactment reveals that Congress is committed to evaluating the effectiveness of the Veterans Experience Office and the quarterly budgetary briefing requirement, and will make informed decisions about the Office's future based on the review's findings.""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",3.064,"{""promptTokens"":0,""completionTokens"":0,""totalTokens"":0}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2025-10-01

Hepatocellular Injury**\n- The elevated levels of **SGOT (AST)** and **SGPT (ALT)** are primary markers of liver cell damage or inflammation. This pattern is commonly seen in conditions such as:\n    - **Viral Hepatitis** (e.g., Hepatitis A, B, or C)\n    - **Alcoholic Liver Disease**\n    - **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**\n    - Toxin or drug-induced liver injury.\n\n**2. Cholestasis / Impaired Bile Flow**\n- The elevated **Total and Direct Bilirubin** levels indicate a condition known as **cholestasis**, where the flow of bile from the liver is reduced or blocked.\n- The fact that **Direct Bilirubin** is disproportionately high suggests a **post-hepatic or obstructive** component, which could be due to:\n    - **Gallstones** in the bile duct\n    - **Biliary stricture** or obstruction\n- The **Alkaline Phosphatase** level is within the normal range, which can help differentiate the cause, but the elevated direct bilirubin is a strong indicator of an obstructive process.\n\n**3. Synthetic Liver Dysfunction**\n- The low levels of **Serum Total Protein** and **Serum Albumin** indicate that the liver's ability to synthesize proteins is impaired.\n- This is a sign of **chronic liver disease** or significant, longstanding liver damage, as seen in conditions like:\n    - **Cirrhosis**\n    - **Chronic Hepatitis**\n\n### Clinical Correlation\nThe combination of **hepatocellular injury** (elevated AST/ALT), **cholestasis** (elevated direct bilirubin), and **impaired synthetic function** (low albumin) presents a mixed picture. This often points to a significant and potentially chronic liver condition affecting multiple functions of the organ. As advised on the report, these findings **must be correlated with clinical findings** (such as patient history, physical examination for jaundice or liver enlargement, and other symptoms) for an accurate diagnosis.""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",29.256,"{""promptTokens"":0,""completionTokens"":0,""totalTokens"":0}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2025-10-01

The documents indicate that methods preserving class-discriminative capacity with minimal further memorization yield strong fairness gains, which aligns with FMD's approach of using counterfactual samples and a joint loss to enforce patch-invariance.

However, the documents do contain significant information about its components and purpose.\n\n### The Co-BUM Metric\n\nThe paper introduces **Co-BUM** as a **unified evaluation metric** designed for the comprehensive assessment of machine unlearning models. It is used to adjudicate which model is \""best\"" by balancing multiple, often competing, objectives since no single scalar measure is sufficient.\n\n#### Component Metrics of Co-BUM\n\nWhile the documents do not list five explicit metrics by name, they describe the multifaceted objectives that Co-BUM combines. The evaluation of unlearning strategies is based on their performance across several key areas:\n\n*   **Unlearning Effectiveness (Forgetting):** The primary goal is to assess how well the model has forgotten the specific \""forget\"" data. A large gap in performance between retain and forget sets indicates successful unlearning.\n*   **Model Utility (Retention):** The model must maintain its performance on the main task for the data it should \""retain.\"" This preserves the model's general class-discriminative capacity and accuracy.\n*   **Privacy & Security (Resistance to Membership Inference Attacks - MIA):** A successful unlearning method should leave no trace of the forgotten data, resulting in low success rates for MIA, which tests if data can be identified as having been in the training set.\n*   **Fairness:** The document mentions \""strong fairness gains\"" as one of the objectives a good unlearning strategy should achieve, suggesting Co-BUM evaluates the model's fairness post-unlearning.\n\nThe documents also reference a **RA-TA gap** (likely Retain Accuracy - Target Accuracy/Forget Accuracy gap) which serves as a diagnostic tool within this framework. A small gap signals targeted forgetting, while a large gap indicates indiscriminate model degradation.\n\n#### Implementation and Weighting\n\nThe Co-BUM score is a weighted combination of its components. The documents provide the specific parameters used for calculation:\n\nThe weighting is defined by the formula and parameters in the provided table:\n`Final Score = (1 - BERT F1 Semantic (7) + w -Enhanced Score ... Directional`\n\nThe specific parameters from **Table 1** are:\n*   `αQ`: `1`\n*   `αP`: `1`\n*   `αE`: `1`\n*   `γ` (asymmetry penalty): `0.5`\n*   `K` (scaling factor): `1`\n\nThese parameters (`α`'s, `γ`, and `K`) were determined through iterative experimentation to maximize alignment with the complex objectives of unlearning.\n\nAvailable Documents:\n\n[0] Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models.pdf: raight for a few correctness. steps and turn left.

These are:\n\n- **Hard Unlearning**: This method, also called **Exact Unlearning**, aims to perform complete retraining on the retain dataset, `Dᵣ`. The goal is for the updated model's parameters to approximate the behavior of a model retrained only on the unbiased data.\n\n- **Gradient Ascent**: This strategy is mentioned as one of the five evaluated methods for the unlearning process.\n\n- **LoRA-based Fine-Tuning**: This approach utilizes **rank-8 LoRA adapters** that are inserted at the late convolutional blocks (specifically blocks 3-4) of the model.\n\n- **SCRUB**: This method involves using a teacher-student framework. It minimizes the **KL divergence** between the teacher's softmax output (from an unbiased teacher model, often obtained after Exact Unlearning) and the student's output.\n\n- The fifth strategy is not explicitly named in the provided text fragments.

It minimizes the **KL divergence** between the teacher's softmax output (from an unbiased teacher model, often obtained after Exact Unlearning) and the student's output.\n\n- The fifth strategy is not explicitly named in the provided text fragments.

The core goal is to reduce a model's reliance on spurious correlations (`b`) and ensure its predictions are primarily driven by the task-relevant signal (`S`).\n\n#### Key Formulation\n\nThe process is formally defined as:\n- Identifying a **biased subset** `Db` from the training data `D_train`.\n- Modifying the model so that its updated parameters `Θ'` approximate the behavior of a model retrained *without* this biased data.\n\nThis is represented by the formulation:\n`fΘ' ≈ fΘ*, where Θ* = L(f₀, \\D₆)`\n\n#### Practical Implementation\n\nThe objective is achieved through specific unlearning strategies, such as:\n- **Hard Unlearning (Exact Unlearning)**: The goal is to perform a complete retraining on the retained dataset `D_r`, effectively removing all influence of the biased data subset.\n\nThis approach provides a targeted method for **\""controllable forgetting\""** of biased patterns, moving towards fairer and more reliable vision models without the high computational cost of full model retraining.\n\nAvailable Documents:\n\n[0] Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning.pdf: Antonio Torralba and Alexei A Efros.

These datasets represent different forms of bias, including localized biases (e.g., synthetic patch in CIFAR-10) and distributed biases (e.g., pose in CUB-200).\n\n### Main Finding\nThe main finding regarding the effectiveness of different unlearning strategies for localized biases like the synthetic patch in CIFAR-10 versus distributed biases like pose in CUB-200 is as follows:\n\n* **Localized biases (e.g., synthetic patch in CIFAR-10)**: The study finds that baseline unlearning strategies are effective in removing localized biases, achieving a steady trade-off between forgetting and retention accuracy (RA-TA gap).\n* **Distributed biases (e.g., pose in CUB-200)**: In contrast, parameter-efficient fine-tuning struggles with distributed biases like pose, failing to disentangle class predictions from pose (evidenced by a high RA, but poor TA and EO). Therefore, boundary-pushing methods like Co-BUM are more effective for diffuse biases.\n\n### Implications\nThe study highlights the need to jointly consider unlearning and fairness in bias mitigation. While unlearning removes spurious correlations, fairness metrics reveal which correlations are excised and whether subgroup equity is achieved. The results suggest that different unlearning strategies are more effective for different types of biases, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and contextualization in bias mitigation.\n\n### Comparison of Unlearning Strategies\nThe study evaluates four complementary unlearning metrics: RA (Retention Accuracy), TA (Target Accuracy), EO (Exposure Overlap), and utility and privacy. The results show that:\n\n* **Co-BUM**: Rewards alignment of forgetting, fairness, utility, and subgroup equity, making it effective for diffuse biases like pose in CUB-200.\n* **Baseline**: Effective for localized biases like the synthetic patch in CIFAR-10, achieving a steady trade-off between forgetting and retention accuracy (RA-TA gap).\n* **Diffuse biases**: Boundary-pushing methods like Co-BUM are more effective for diffuse biases, as they fail to disentangle class predictions from pose.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe study emphasizes the importance of adaptability and contextualization in bias mitigation, highlighting the need to jointly consider unlearning and fairness. The results suggest that different unlearning strategies are more effective for different types of biases, and that Co-BUM is a promising approach for diffuse biases like pose in CUB-200.\n\nAvailable Documents:\n\n[0] Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning.pdf: getting and Proxy Bias on This effectively reduces the estimated influence of the CIFAR-10 bias encoded in fΘ with minimal computational cost.

These datasets represent different forms of bias, including localized biases (e.g., synthetic patch in CIFAR-10) and distributed biases (e.g., pose in CUB-200).\n\n### Main Finding\nThe main finding regarding the effectiveness of different unlearning strategies for localized biases like the synthetic patch in CIFAR-10 versus distributed biases like pose in CUB-200 is as follows:\n\n* **Localized biases (e.g., synthetic patch in CIFAR-10)**: The study finds that baseline unlearning strategies are effective in removing localized biases, achieving a steady trade-off between forgetting and retention accuracy (RA-TA gap).\n* **Distributed biases (e.g., pose in CUB-200)**: In contrast, parameter-efficient fine-tuning struggles with distributed biases like pose, failing to disentangle class predictions from pose (evidenced by a high RA, but poor TA and EO). Therefore, boundary-pushing methods like Co-BUM are more effective for diffuse biases.\n\n### Implications\nThe study highlights the need to jointly consider unlearning and fairness in bias mitigation. While unlearning removes spurious correlations, fairness metrics reveal which correlations are excised and whether subgroup equity is achieved. The results suggest that different unlearning strategies are more effective for different types of biases, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and contextualization in bias mitigation.\n\n### Comparison of Unlearning Strategies\nThe study evaluates four complementary unlearning metrics: RA (Retention Accuracy), TA (Target Accuracy), EO (Exposure Overlap), and utility and privacy. The results show that:\n\n* **Co-BUM**: Rewards alignment of forgetting, fairness, utility, and subgroup equity, making it effective for diffuse biases like pose in CUB-200.\n* **Baseline**: Effective for localized biases like the synthetic patch in CIFAR-10, achieving a steady trade-off between forgetting and retention accuracy (RA-TA gap).\n* **Diffuse biases**: Boundary-pushing methods like Co-BUM are more effective for diffuse biases, as they fail to disentangle class predictions from pose.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe study emphasizes the importance of adaptability and contextualization in bias mitigation, highlighting the need to jointly consider unlearning and fairness. The results suggest that different unlearning strategies are more effective for different types of biases, and that Co-BUM is a promising approach for diffuse biases like pose in CUB-200.""}","{""resourceAttributes"":{""telemetry.sdk.language"":""python"",""telemetry.sdk.name"":""opentelemetry"",""telemetry.sdk.version"":""1.37.0"",""service.name"":""unknown_service""},""scope"":{""name"":""langfuse-sdk"",""version"":""3.3.4"",""attributes"":{""public_key"":""pk-lf-fafa2ace-f23e-4ea3-bde7-74a98ec962ff""}}}",1.865,"{""promptTokens"":1057,""completionTokens"":518,""totalTokens"":1575}",,,,DEFAULT,0,0,3,0,3,1057,518,1575,2025-10-01

The goal is to adjust the model's parameters to perform poorly on a specific dataset (Df) while retaining performance on another dataset (Dr).\n\n#### Update Rule\n\nThe update rule for Gradient Ascent unlearning is as follows:\n\n**Update Rule:**\n```python\nΘᵤ = Θ₀ + n \\* ∇L(Θ₀, Df)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `Θᵤ` is the updated model parameter\n* `Θ₀` is the initial model parameter\n* `n` is the ascent learning rate\n* `∇L(Θ₀, Df)` is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameter `Θ₀` on the dataset `Df`\n\nHowever, according to the text, this update rule is actually used to _reverse_ the update step, so the actual update rule for Gradient Ascent unlearning is:\n\n**Reversed Update Rule:**\n```python\nΘᵤ = Θ₀ - n \\* ∇L(Θ₀, Df)\n```\n\nThis update rule is used to adjust the model's parameters to perform poorly on the dataset `Df`.\n\nAvailable Documents:\n\n[0] Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning.pdf: pecific learned associations by ex- Hard Unlearning: Involves retraining the model from plicitly maximizing the loss on the forget set Df.

This is achieved by modifying the model such that its updated parameters approximate the behavior of a retrained model on unbiased data.\n\n### Key Formulation\n\nThe bias-aware unlearning process is formulated as follows:\n\n`Θ' ≈ fΘ*`\n\nwhere `Θ'` represents the updated model parameters, `fΘ*` represents the behavior of a retrained model on unbiased data, and `Θ* = L(f₀, \\D₆)` represents the learned model parameters on the original dataset.\n\n### Practical Correction Strategy\n\nThe bias-aware unlearning process is a practical, post-hoc correction strategy that avoids retraining the model from scratch. Instead, it modifies the existing model parameters to approximate the behavior of a retrained model on unbiased data.\n\n### Goal of Bias-Aware Unlearning\n\nThe goal of bias-aware unlearning is to reduce the model's reliance on biased features (`b`) and ensure that predictions are primarily driven by task-relevant signals (`S`). This is achieved by identifying a biased subset of data (`Db C Dₜᵣₐᵢₙ`) and modifying the model to approximate the behavior of a retrained model on unbiased data.\n\n### Bias Settings\n\nThe bias settings employed across the three unlearning strategies are:\n\n- **Hard Unlearning**: Also called Exact Unlearning, this method performs complete retraining on the retain dataset (`Dᵣ`).\n- [Other bias settings are not specified in the provided document]\n\nAvailable Documents:\n\n[0] Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning.pdf: t forget too much: Towards machine unlearning on feature level.
